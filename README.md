# Pacman
The project is based on a game called Pac man in which the player controls Pac man, who must eat all dots inside a maze before the ghosts present in the maze can hunt him down. Eating the large pellets present in the maze causes the ghosts to turn blue, and Pac-man can eat them to get extra points. At the end of the game the score attained by the player will be saved so that he can try to beat it later. 

The project was implemented in Visual Studio Using C++ with an additional library called SFML for displaying the texture as well as registering inputs while the program is running
